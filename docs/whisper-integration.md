# WhisperCPP WebAssembly Integration

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of WhisperCPP WebAssembly integration for the whisper-web-transcription project. The integration provides real-time and batch audio transcription capabilities using the Whisper model running entirely in the browser.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WhisperWorker** (`src/workers/whisper-worker.js`)
   - Web Worker that runs Whisper model in background thread
   - Prevents blocking the main UI thread during transcription
   - Uses Xenova's transformers.js library for WebAssembly execution

2. **TranscriptionManager** (`src/managers/TranscriptionManager.js`)
   - Main interface for transcription functionality
   - Manages Web Worker communication
   - Handles model loading, progress tracking, and error handling

### Dependencies

- `@xenova/transformers`: Provides WebAssembly-based Whisper model execution
- Uses Whisper Tiny model for optimal performance and loading speed

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Model Loading
- Asynchronous model initialization with progress tracking
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Model status checking and validation

### ✅ Audio Transcription
- Single audio buffer transcription
- Language detection and manual language selection
- Confidence scoring and result metadata

### ✅ Realtime Processing
- Audio chunk-based processing for streaming transcription
- Parallel processing of multiple audio segments
- Partial result handling for real-time updates

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- Worker crash recovery
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

### ✅ Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of Web Workers and memory
- Progress callbacks for UI updates
- Configurable language settings

## API Reference

### TranscriptionManager

#### Initialization
```javascript
const manager = new TranscriptionManager()
await manager.init()
await manager.loadWhisperModel()
```

#### Basic Transcription
```javascript
const audioBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(audioData)
const result = await manager.transcribeAudio(audioBuffer, 'en')
console.log(result.text, result.confidence, result.language)
```

#### Realtime Transcription
```javascript
const audioChunks = [chunk1, chunk2, chunk3]
const results = await manager.transcribeRealtime(audioChunks)
results.forEach(result => console.log(result.text))
```

#### Automatic Language Detection
```javascript
// Auto-detect language during transcription
const result = await manager.transcribeAudio(audioData, 'auto')
console.log('Detected language:', result.language)
console.log('Transcription:', result.text)
```

#### Configuration
```javascript
manager.setLanguage('zh') // Set to Chinese
manager.setProgressCallback(progress => console.log(`${progress}%`))
manager.setErrorCallback(error => console.error(error))
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for TranscriptionManager class
- ✅ Integration tests for Web Worker communication
- ✅ Error handling and edge case testing
- ✅ Resource management and cleanup testing

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test TranscriptionManager  # Run main test suite
npm test WhisperBasic         # Run basic functionality tests
```

## Performance Considerations

### Model Size and Loading
- Uses Whisper Tiny model (~39MB) for fast loading
- Quantized model for reduced memory usage
- Progressive loading with progress callbacks

### Memory Management
- Web Worker isolation prevents main thread blocking
- Automatic cleanup of audio buffers after processing
- Configurable timeout for long-running operations

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires WebAssembly support (all modern browsers)
- Uses ES6 modules and Web Workers
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Model Loading Failures**
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Insufficient memory
   - WebAssembly initialization errors

2. **Audio Processing Errors**
   - Invalid audio format or data
   - Processing timeouts
   - Worker crashes or communication failures

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Memory limitations
   - Concurrent processing limits
   - Browser security restrictions

## Integration with Main Application

The WhisperCPP integration is designed to be used by:

1. **Real-time Recording** (Task 7)
   - Process audio chunks as they're recorded
   - Display partial results during recording

2. **File Upload Processing** (Task 8)
   - Batch process uploaded audio files
   - Show progress during transcription

3. **UI Controllers** (Task 9)
   - Display loading progress and status
   - Handle error states and user feedback

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Support for larger Whisper models (base, small, medium)
- Custom model loading from user-provided files
- Advanced audio preprocessing and noise reduction
- Batch processing optimization for multiple files

### Performance Optimizations
- Model caching strategies
- Audio compression before processing
- Parallel processing for multiple audio streams
- WebGL acceleration for supported operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Slow**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify CORS headers are properly set
   - Consider using CDN for model files

2. **Transcription Accuracy**
   - Ensure audio quality is sufficient (16kHz recommended)
   - Try manual language selection instead of auto-detect
   - Check for background noise or audio artifacts

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Process shorter audio segments
   - Ensure proper cleanup after transcription
   - Monitor browser memory usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
manager.setErrorCallback(console.error)
manager.setProgressCallback(console.log)
```

## Conclusion

The WhisperCPP WebAssembly integration provides a robust, performant solution for browser-based speech transcription. The implementation handles the complexity of WebAssembly execution, Web Worker management, and error recovery while providing a clean API for the rest of the application.

The modular design allows for easy testing, maintenance, and future enhancements while ensuring optimal performance and user experience.
