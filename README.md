## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher)
-   A modern web browser that supports WebAssembly and `SharedArrayBuffer`.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/whisper-web-transcription.git
    cd whisper-web-transcription
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running in Development Mode

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified files, ready for deployment.

## Development

### Git Workflow

This project follows a feature-branch workflow.

1.  Create a new branch for each feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2.  Write your code and commit your changes with semantic commit messages (e.g., `feat(audio): add support for WAV files`).
3.  Push your branch and create a pull request.

### Scripts

-   `npm run lint`: Lint the code using ESLint.
-   `npm run format`: Format the code using Prettier.
-   `npm run test`: Run the tests using Vitest.
